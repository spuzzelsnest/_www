# Node JS server with Leaflet POI app

Node JS https webserver with MIME type support. 
Added a rework of a Google maps POI website as an example, this time based on the Leaflet API.

## Installation
 Make sure NPM is installed


- run bin/cert.sh to create the HTTPS certificates
```
  cd bin && ./install.sh
```
- Set the secret for the certifications (also in server.js)

- run the server
```
  node server.js
```
