# Node JS servers HTTP | HTTPS

Node JS https webserver with MIME type support. 
Added a rework of a Google maps POI website as an example, this time based on the Leaflet API.

## Installation

- run bin/install.sh to create the HTTPS certificates
```bash
  cd bin && ./install.sh
```
- Set the secret for the certifications (also in server.js)

- run the server
```bash
  node server.js
```
